# Machine-Learning

This project of machine learning consists on predicting the price category of cellphones. The train and test set provide information about different cellphones. After data cleaning and feature engineering the data is ready for splitting in order to test different machine learning algorithms that predict the price category. First came the test of simpler models, like, decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier with bagging and XGBoost. These were tested first because there was no need for standarization when using these models, so it was a faster approach. After performing a feature importance algorithm, the main variables were standardized in order to perform an SVM algorith, which is specially good for classification. This final model reached roughly 98% accuracy and was then implemented on the test set.
